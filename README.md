### 🏆 Nobel Prize Data Analysis with Python

The Nobel Prize is one of the most prestigious international awards, recognizing outstanding contributions to humanity in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, Medicine, and Economics.
In this project, we explore and visualize data about Nobel Prize winners to uncover historical trends, gender patterns, age distributions, and country dominance over time.

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is nobel.csv, which contains information such as:
* Full name of laureates
* Award category
* Birth country
* Gender
* Year of award
* Birth date

### 💡 Project Objectives

1- Identify the top 10 countries with the most Nobel Prizes.
2- List the first female Nobel Prize winners.
3- List the first male Nobel Prize winners.
4- Analyze when the USA began its dominance in Nobel Prizes and discuss contributing factors.
5- Visualize gender, age, category, and year data to interpret demographic trends.
6- Visualize countries and categories of winners during 1938–1945, and discuss wartime effects.
7- Visualize the same for 1947–1991, with separate plots per category.
8- Analyze 2000 and beyond, visualizing the age and country distribution by category
